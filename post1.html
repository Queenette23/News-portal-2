                  <p>PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with a move to Manchester United to fill the vacant managerial role at the club.

                    The Manchester Evening News understands Pochettino is prepared to quit PSG and join United now rather than wait until the summer.
                    
                    The 49-year-old was previously linked with the club after leaving Tottenham, but instead took up a role in the French capital where he once played as a centre-back.
                    
                    He won the Coupe de Frances in his first season, but finished second in Ligue 1 behind Lille.
                    
                    This summer saw the arrival of Lionel Messi from Barcelona, a highly coveted move for Les Parisiens.The 28-year-old joined in 2016 from Juventus for a deal reportedly worth over £90million. With his dwindling contract at the club, Pochettino was heavily linked with a move for the playmaker in the summer.

                    Reports claim that the coach made Pogba his top target in the window, believing he is the perfect player to build a team around.
                    
                    This could make him a key player for him, if Pochettino makes the switch and a new deal can be agreed.However, the PSG boss refused to speak publicly on the pursuit of the playmaker: "The arrival of a midfielder like Pogba? We know that in football things can happen, situations turnaround.

                    "A club like PSG is always open to improving its workforce. A sector where we must strengthen as a priority for me? I won't say it publicly. Never.”The former Spurs manager also made specific reference to Pogba's qualities in 2016, when he urged Dele Alli to become Tottenham’s own version of the France international.

                    He said, per the Mirror : “Today, football is about being versatile. We need to help a player like Dele Alli improve, not put him in a box.
                    
                    “He needs to feel free on the pitch and we need to help him improve in different positions because a versatile player, like Pogba, has a big, big value.”
