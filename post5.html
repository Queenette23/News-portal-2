                Ralf Rangnick has made moves to add to his Manchester United coaching staff.
                
                Rangnick made a bright start to life as United interim manager with a promising 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday and now he has made steps to put his own spin on his backroom team.
                
                Former New York Red Bulls and Toronto FC boss Chris Armas has been lined up to join as a coach after working with the German during his six years at Reb Bull.
                
                The club will also be appointing sports psychologist Sascha Lense, who will be starting his work at Carrington later this week once his visa process is finalised.
                
                But the 46-year-old met the players for the first time on Monday. He will join the club in a position on Rangnick's coaching staff rather than coming under the medical department.
                
                Meanwhile, United have drawn Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round.
                
                Stay tuned for the latest news throughout the day.

                Cristiano Ronaldo has passed Ralf Rangnick's first United challenge
                Ralf Rangnick is a manager who is fascinated by the statistical side of football but you don't need to dive deep into that world in order to realise his immediate impact at Manchester United.
                
                While facts and figures can help pinpoint the precise changes which Rangnick has already brought to Old Trafford in a short space of time the greatest barometer for his influence can simply be witnessed by the way United operate out on the pitch.
                
                Victory over Crystal Palace at the weekend wasn't without blemishes but there was a noticeable contrast within the way United controlled the game and executed a game plan which they barely had time to learn.
